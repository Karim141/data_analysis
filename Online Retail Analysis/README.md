# Exploratory Data Analysis of the Online Retail Dataset

## Overview

This README documents the exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a dataset that includes transactions from an online store. The aim of the analysis is to gain insights into sales patterns, customer trends, and pricing structures.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis, `online_retail.csv`, is sourced from Kaggle. It can be accessed at the following URL: [Online Retail Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/online-retail-dataset).

The `online_retail.csv` dataset contains the following key columns:
- `InvoiceNo`: Invoice number
- `StockCode`: Product code
- `Description`: Product description
- `Quantity`: Quantity sold
- `InvoiceDate`: Date of the invoice
- `UnitPrice`: Price per unit
- `CustomerID`: Customer identification number
- `Country`: Country of the customer

## Data Preparation

### Data Cleaning

Data was first checked for missing values and cleaned accordingly. Transactions without a `CustomerID` and canceled transactions (those where `InvoiceNo` starts with 'C') were removed to ensure data quality.

### Conversion

The `InvoiceDate` column was converted to datetime format to facilitate time series analysis.

## Descriptive Statistics

Basic descriptive statistics were generated to provide an overview of the data, including mean, median, and standard deviation, which help identify general trends and outliers in the dataset.

## Data Visualization and Analysis

### Distribution of Product Quantities

The histogram of product quantities shows most products are purchased in small quantities, indicating typical consumer buying behavior.
